# 🛠️ Ease My Life Scripts
**Version 1.2 • Authored by Alfredo Jo ® • 2025**


A collection of simple, practical, and time-saving scripts created to automate the repetitive tasks that slow me down.  
These scripts exist for one purpose: **to make my life easier** — whether it's system cleanup, network checks, file management, or everyday workflow shortcuts.\
You can find additional scripts in the [Network Infra as Code](https://github.com/zo718/network_infra_as_code) repo under the scripts directory. Those are more tailored for network and Linux automation.

## 🎯 Purpose

I built this repo as a growing toolbox of small utilities that help:
- Reduce repetitive manual work  
- Speed up common tasks  
- Keep workflows clean and consistent  
- Prevent “why am I doing this again?” moments  

If a task annoys me more than once, it probably ends up here as a script.

## 📁 What You’ll Find

This repo may include:
- Bash scripts for system and network tasks  
- Python utilities for quick automation  
- Helpers for configuration, parsing, or cleanup  
- One-liners turned into reusable tools  
- Anything else that saves time or sanity  

Expect the content to grow organically as more daily annoyances get automated.

## 🚧 Status

This project is a work in progress — more scripts, context, and examples will be added as I go.  
Feel free to explore, borrow ideas, or adapt anything for your own workflow.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Please test any script in a safe environment before using it in production or on critical systems.  
While I aim to keep everything reliable and idempotent, every setup is different.  
Use at your own discretion.

## 🤝 Contributions (Optional)

## 💬 Final Thoughts

Automation isn’t about laziness, it’s about working smarter.  
If a small script can save time or prevent frustration, it belongs here.

Enjoy, tweak, and keep life easy. 😄
